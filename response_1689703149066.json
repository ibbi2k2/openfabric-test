    " we study the effect of the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction on the energy spectrum of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field. \n we find that the interaction between the magnetic field and the 2d electron gas leads to a significant enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling in the vicinity of the fermi level.    * \n pacs number(s ) : * 03."
